Moderate MET-minutes/week = 4.0 * moderate-intensity activity minutes * moderate days
Vigorous MET-minutes/week = 8.0 * vigorous-intensity activity minutes * vigorous-intensity days
A combined total physical activity MET-min/week can be computed as the sum of Walking + Moderate + Vigorous MET-min/week scores.
