# Week 1 - Introduction

## Study Types

- Experimental
	- subjects randomly assigned to exposure categories
	- clinical trial: special case of experimental study where subjects randomly assigned to treatment group and followed forward in time to determine outcome
	- A/B testing: another special case. Typically users presented with some user interface and randomly presented with one of two versions of the site (A vs. B). Investigator compares some metric (did the user click through to enroll in health insurance?) between the two versions

- Quasi-experimental
	- subjects identified by exposure levels, but without randomization
	- cohort study: subjects identified by exposure status and followed forward in time to determine outcome
	- case-control study: subjects identified by outcome status (e.g. presence of diseease) and then exposure status determined retrospectively

- Observational
	- no randomization or assignment of subject by exposure levels
	- cross-sectional study: individuals' exposure and outcome status determined simultaneously (i.e. no randomization, and exposure/outcome status not used as selection criteria)


## Types of Variables

- Continuous: any variable such that between any two potentially observable values, there exists another potentially observable value
	- ex: age, height, cholesterol, lung function

- Discrete
	- ordered numeric (ordinal): variables have numerical, non-continuous values (e.g. number of deaths, number of school absences)
	- ordered categories: non-numeric but have ordered values (e.g. high, medium, low)
	- unordered categories (nominal): no inherent order (e.g. race, study site)
	- binary (dichotomous): two categories (e.g. mortality status)
